Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------

*** 2001-November-11 ***
This release includes quite a few new features
and enhancements -- including this RELEASENOTES
document.

New Features:
 - Teachers can now leave individualized notes
   for students/parents by using the "Individual
   Notes" feature.  If you are upgrading your
   version of Basmati prior to the 2.2001.11.01 
   version, you'll need to add support for the
   additional database table within Basmati.
   Typically, this can be done my executing the
   createdb.sql script with the -f script.  
   Errors will be generated when trying to create
   tables that already exist, but the -f 
   switch will continue processing so that the 
   new table can be created.
 - Live statistics can be gathered from the
   site by viewing /xtools/stats.htm  
   (You may need to edit stats.php for local
   subnet values).
 - A few other tools can be found in the xtools
   folder... they should be considered expirimental.
   Use at your own risk.


Enhancements:
 - Cascading Style Sheets allow for global customi-
   zation of background color and fonts.  Simply copy
   the "example_style.css" file to "style.css" and
   edit to your tastes.
 - Some of the table column headings and button names
   have been changed to make more sense.
 - The following Misc tags may be used to control
   the behaviour of the web progress reports:
	"-disc" will remove the disclaimer
	"-pp" will remove the points-possible column
 - To allow a future Excel macro to be used as
   a gradebook, assignment values can now be separated
   by chr(169) as well as a comma.  Basmati will
   attempt to autodetect.


*** 2001-November-16 ***
New graphics have been added to the system per the
help of Mr. J. Wilson of Arlington School District.


*** 2002-January-16 ***
Added $districtid to basmaticonstants.php to allow
for improved security when multiple districts are
hosted on the same server.


*** 2002-March-12 ***
A request from Friday Harbor School District to
include the ability to print standard numerical
comments from Grade Machine or EGP.  Developed
pages to import TSV comment lists, and display
them on the student gradebook reports.  This requires
that the createdb.sql program be run to
use the new COMMENTLIST tables.  It is possible
to turn this feature off (on a teacher-by-teacher
basis) by adding "-comlist" to the misc 3 field.
