Release Notes
-------------------------------------------------

*** 2001-November-11 ***
This release includes quite a few new features
and enhancements -- including this RELEASENOTES
document.

New Features:
 - Teachers can now leave individualized notes
   for students/parents by using the "Individual
   Notes" feature.  If you are upgrading your
   version of Basmati prior to the 2.2001.11.01 
   version, you'll need to add support for the
   additional database table within Basmati.
   Typically, this can be done my executing the
   createdb.sql script with the -f script.  
   Errors will be generated when trying to create
   tables that already exist, but the -f 
   switch will continue processing so that the 
   new table can be created.
 - Live statistics can be gathered from the
   site by viewing /xtools/stats.htm  
   (You may need to edit stats.php for local
   subnet values).
 - A few other tools can be found in the xtools
   folder... they should be considered expirimental.
   Use at your own risk.


Enhancements:
 - Cascading Style Sheets allow for global customi-
   zation of background color and fonts.  Simply copy
   the "example_style.css" file to "style.css" and
   edit to your tastes.
 - Some of the table column headings and button names
   have been changed to make more sense.
 - The following Misc tags may be used to control
   the behaviour of the web progress reports:
	"-disc" will remove the disclaimer
	"-pp" will remove the points-possible column
 - To allow a future Excel macro to be used as
   a gradebook, assignment values can now be separated
   by chr(169) as well as a comma.  Basmati will
   attempt to autodetect.
