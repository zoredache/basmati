<P>An understanding of good health and fitness concepts and practices is 
essential for all students. Businesses have already begun to realize the extent 
to which poor health practices can undermine an employee's effectiveness and 
ability to succeed. The same is true of students. Teaching our students good 
health and safety principles can lead to a lifetime of healthy practices, 
resulting in more productive, active, and successful lives. The Essential 
Academic Learning Requirements in health and fitness establish the concepts and 
skills necessary for safe and healthy living, and in turn, for successful 
learning.</P>
