realizes that the U.S. history content contained in the shaded area is not 
traditionally taught until the 11th grade. At this time, decisions pending on 
several issues, including the Certificate of Mastery, Goal II assessment, and 
State Board of Education requirements for high school graduation, may influence 
this section of the document in the future. However, the content was included to 
both align with the legislation, which states that successful mastery of the 
knowledge and core concepts of history should occur by about age 16, and to 
include the full continuum of U.S. history in what is a comprehensive learning 
document.</P>
