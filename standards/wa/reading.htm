<P><B>Reading for Today and Tomorrow </B>- To facilitate the optimal development 
of reading ability, the cooperation of the community, family, school, student,

individual becoming a constructive member of society and enhance the likelihood 
of becoming an active lifelong reader. The written word is important to the 
understanding of cultural heritage and to the acquisition of knowledge about the 
world. Hence, we must ensure equal access to excellent reading instruction and 
opportunities to learn for all students.</P>
<P><B>What Is Reading?</B> - Reading is the process of constructing meaning 
through the dynamic interaction among the reader's existing knowledge, the 
information suggested by the written language, and the context of the reading 
situation. It is fundamental to literacy.</P>
