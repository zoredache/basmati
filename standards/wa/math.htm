<P><B>Mathematics for Today and Tomorrow</B> - Mathematics continues to grow at 
a rapid rate, spreading into new fields and creating new applications, in its 
open-ended search for patterns. Several factors -- growth of technology, 
increased applications, impact of computers, and expansion of mathematics itself 
-- have combined in the past century to extend greatly both the scope and the 
application of the mathematical sciences. The changes must be reflected in the 
schools if our students are to be well prepared for tomorrow's world.</P>
<P><B>What is Mathematics?</B> - Mathematics is a language and science of 
patterns.</P>
<P>As a language of patterns, mathematics is a means for describing the world in 
which we live. In its symbols and vocabulary, the language of mathematics is a 
universal means of communication about relationships and patterns.</P>
<P>As a science of patterns, mathematics is a mode of inquiry that reveals 
fundamental understandings about order in our world. This mode of inquiry relies 
on logic and employs observation, simulation, and experimentation as means of 
challenging and extending our current understanding.</P>
<P><B>Toward a deeper study of important mathematics</B> - More than at any 
other time in history, society is placing demands on citizens to interpret and 
use mathematics to make sense of information and complex situations. Computers 
and other technologies have increased our capacities for dealing with numbers, 
for collecting, organizing, representing, and analyzing data. Tables, lists of 
numbers, graphs of data, and statistics summarizing information occur in every 
form of the media.</P>
<P>To be well informed as adults and to have access to desirable jobs, students 
today require an education in mathematics that goes far beyond what was needed 
by students in the past. All students must develop and sharpen their skills, 
deepen their understanding of mathematical concepts and processes, and hone 
their problem-solving, reasoning, and communication abilities while using 
mathematics to make sense of, and to solve, compelling problems. All students 
need a deep understanding of mathematics; for this to occur, rigorous 
mathematical content must be reorganized, taught, and assessed in a 
problem-solving environment. For students to develop this deeper level of 
understanding, their knowledge must be connected to a variety of ideas and 
skills across topic areas and grade levels in mathematics, to other subjects 
taught in school, as well as to situations outside the classroom.</P>
