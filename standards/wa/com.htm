<P><B>What Is Communication?</B> - Communication is defined as a process by 
which we assign and convey meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding. 
This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in intrapersonal and 
interpersonal processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, 
analyzing, and evaluating. Use of these processes is developmental and transfers 
to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through 
communication that collaboration and cooperation occur.</P>
<P><B>Fundamental Beliefs About Curriculum and Assessment</B> - If there is one 
unifying theme that crosses all disciplines, it is communication. Communication 
is our window to basic literacy and academic excellence. Reaching levels of 
excellence and accuracy of expression mandate mastery of formal English. These 
are the capabilities that cultivate the potential in each student and the 
possibilities for our future.</P>
