<P>Learning in science depends on actively doing science. Active engagement in 
hands-on, minds-on science learning experiences enables students to make 
personal sense of the physical world and to solve problems. Toward these ends, 
the Essential Academic Learning Requirements for science were developed based on 
the following set of guiding principles.</P>
<P>1. All students should be expected to attain satisfactory achievement and 
performance on all Essential Academic Learning Requirements.</P>
<P>2. All students should have access to a carefully articulated science program 
<B>each year</B> in kindergarten through 10th grade with opportunities for 
continued study in grades 11 and 12.</P>
<P>3. All students should receive quality feedback about their performance and 
achievement in science on a continuous basis.</P>
<P>4. All students, regardless of gender, cultural or ethnic background, 
physical or learning disabilities, aspirations, or interest and motivation in 
science, should have the opportunity to attain scientific literacy.</P>
<P>5. All students should have access to effective and appropriate teaching from 
well trained teachers who are supported with high quality instructional 
resources.</P>
<P>If all students attain mastery of the Essential Academic Learning 
Requirements for science, Washington State will be much closer to attaining the 
national goal of being the first in the world in science achievement and 
performance.</P>
