Setting Up School & Faculty Accounts
</h3>
</center>
<hr>
Once you've installed Basmati and created its database, you need to set up school accounts and faculty accounts.
The instructions below outline these procedures.  All of these must be performed from the Basmati administrator
account (you can access this with the <i>admin.htm</i> file).  You'll need to log in as the administrator.
<ul>
<li><b>Create School Account(s).</b>  Basmati will support multiple schools from the same server.  Click the "Add School"
link and supply the following information:
<ul>
<li><font color=brown>School ID</font> -- The school ID is a shortened description of the school you will
create.  For example, "Jefferson High School" would probably use a school ID of <b>JHS</b>.  Each school that
you create should have a <b>unique</b> school ID.  The school ID will be used when you create a faculty account (each
faculty member will be assigned to a particular school via this ID).
<li><font color=brown>School Name</font> -- The school name is the full name of the school (such as "Jefferson High School").  
This should be unique too, as this will appear on the internet login-page for parents and students.
<li><font color=brown>School State and City</font> -- If you are hosting Basmati for multiple districts, this information may be useful.
<li><font color=brown>School URL</font> -- If a school has a web-page, enter their full URL (such as http://www.jhs.edu).  At this point,
Basmati will not link to these URLs, but may in future versions.
</ul>
<p>
<li><b>Create Faculty Account(s).</b>  Click the "Add Client" link to add a faculty member to Basmati.  Without a faculty account,
a teacher will not be able to submit files to Basmati (or check student grades).  The following information must
be supplied for each faculty account:
<ul>
<li><font color=brown>School ID</font> -- You must assign each faculty member to a school via the school ID.  Presently, a faculty member
may belong to only one school.  In the school created above, you would enter JHS for the school ID (not the long school description).
<li><font color=brown>Client ID</font> -- Each faculty member is assigned a login ID.  For simplicity's sake, you should consider
using the faculty member's email address (for example, jsmith@asd.wednet.edu).  Each client ID must be <b>unique</b> within the database system. 
<li><font color=brown>Client PW</font> -- Each faculty member must also be assigned a password.  When their password is combined with their client ID,
a faculty member will be able to log into the system to submit grades.
<li><font color=brown>Client Exp. Date</font> -- Presently, this is not used within Basmati, but when added will provide an expiration date for
each faculty account.  Although non-functional, a date is still required to create the account.
<li><font color=brown>Client Full Name</font>  --  The full name of the faculty member should appear here.  This name is never displayed within
the web-pages of Basmati, but is used for record-keeping purposes.
</ul>
<br>
Once the faculty account has been created, you must provide the teacher with their Client ID and Client Password -- these will be used to log into
the system <i>and</i> within their electronic gradebooks.  Spelling must be accurate!  To test the account, you can visit the faculty page (faculty.htm)
and log into the system.
<p>
It is possible to use a single faculty account for an entire building, but this practice is strongly discouraged for security reasons.
</ul>
<p>
If any changes (or deletions) are required, they currently must be accomplished by submitting an SQL query.  Details about using this feature can
be found on a separate page.
