<h3>
Using SQL Queries
</h3>
</center>
<hr>
SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful language used to create, alter, or delete 
components of a database.  There are probably thousands of resources on the Web that will teach
you how to use SQL.  I will provide you with a few simple queries to do day-to-day administrative
tasks, but you are encouraged to look elsewhere to learn more powerful queries.	 It is important
to understand what you're doing when submitting a query -- you can easily destroy an entire database
in the matter of seconds with a few words of SQL.
<p>
Before looking at SQL, it is important to understand the structure of the Basmati database.  The chart
below provides a snapshot of the tables and fields within the database:
<p>
<table border=1>
<tr bgcolor=yellow>
<th>Tables:</th>
<th>CLIENTS</th>
<th>COURSEINFO</th>
<th>GMSCORES</th>
<th>GROUPS</th>
<th>PERSONAL</th>
<th>SCHOOLS</th>
</tr>
<td valign=top>Fields:

</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

A more complete description of each field is pending.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
One of the most useful queries is the SELECT query -- which allows you to easily view the
contents of your database.  The syntax for this query is very straightforward.  Several
examples are shown below:
<center>
<i>
SELECT * FROM COURSEINFO;
<br>
SELECT * FROM COURSEINFO WHERE CC = 'CAL50203';
<BR>
SELECT * FROM COURSEINFO ORDER BY CC;
<BR>
SELECT FACULTYNAME, EMAIL FROM COURSEINFO ORDER BY EMAIL;
</i>
</center>
<br>
Get the picture?  The generic form for the SELECT statement is SELECT {fields or *} FROM {table} WHERE {fieldname} {comparison} {value}.
<p>
<li>
Perhaps the next most useful statement is the DELETE verb.  Be very careful with this one -- if you don't qualify
what you're deleting, you'll probably end up deleting the entire table!  Here are some examples:
<center><i>
DELETE FROM COURSEINFO;  </i>(Careful!  This will delete the entire table!)<i>
<br>
DELETE FROM COURSEINFO WHERE CC = 'CAL50203';
<p>
</center>
</i>
<li>
To modify an existing field in a table, use the UPDATE statement.  For example, let's suppose
that we need to change the name of the course (coursename) corresponding the the coursecode 'CAL50203'.
The SQL statement used to do this would be...
<center>
<i>
UPDATE COURSEINFO SET coursename = 'newemailaddress@here.com' WHERE CC = 'CAL50203';
</i>
</center>
In practice, there is no reason to actually do this -- when you send an export file to Basmati, any changes (such as email address)
should automatically be reflected.
<p>
<li>
Finally, you can use the INSERT statement to add a new record to a table.  Here's a brief example (adding a new record to the CLEINTS table):
<center>
<i>
INSERT INTO CLIENTS (client_id, client_pw, client_school, client_expdate, client_fullname) VALUES
('me@here.com', 'password', 'HS', '8/4/2002', 'Mr. Me.');
</i></center>
<p>
</ul>
Again, please consult many of the excellent references on SQL for more details (and more powerful queries).
