Creating the Basmati Database
</h3>
</center>
<hr>
If you've installed the Windows NT/2000 version of Basmati, you're done!  You <i>won't</i>
need to use the "Create Database" Link in the Admin Toolkit.
<p>
If you've installed the Linux version -- you've got some work to do.  Instructions
to follow sometime soon...  (hint -- you're going to need MySQL from <a href = http://www.mysql.com>
www.mysql.com</a>).
