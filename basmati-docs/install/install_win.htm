Installing Basmati with Microsoft's IIS and ODBC

</h3>

<p>

This document is intended for someone familiar with Microsoft's IIS (version 4.0 or 5.0).  If

you have little or no experience with IIS, you may need to contact your Basmati distributor for

extended installation support.  I would also strongly suggest the use of MySQL as the
database server rather than using ODBC.  Consult the Linux installation guide for details
on configuring the software to run with MySQL instead of ODBC.  As of July, 2001, I will
no longer be developing additional components for the ODBC version... there are already
several features available only in the MySQL version.

<p>

This version

of Basmati uses PHP as its primary development language -- this enables development on multiple

platforms (including Windows [IIS and Apache] and Linux).  You are welcome to modify the source

code to meet your particular security needs or use some of the security features of your web-server.

You are entirely responsible for securing your web-sites.

<p>

Here are the steps to install Basmati...

<ol>

<li>Obtain PHP from <a href=http://www.php.net>http://www.php.net</a>.   Download the latest stable version and install according to the directions provided

by PHP.  To test that the installation was successful, create a text-document in a web-shared folder

(call it <i>test.php</i>)

and insert the following code into it:

<font size=+0><pre> &lt? phpinfo() ?&gt </pre></font>

Open this file <i>through your web server</i> (e.g., http://localhost/test.php).  If you see

a page with <i>LOTS</i> of information describing your PHP capabilities, you were successful.  If not, please

consult the FAQs or online help at www.php.net.  If everything worked, you may delete this test file.<p>

<li>

Download the Basmati script files and unzip them into a temporary directory.<p>

<li>Before proceeding any further -- it is time to change the administrator password!  Locate the script

file called <i>example_basmaticonstants.php</i> and make a copy of
this file.  Rename the copy to "basmaticonstants.php".  Open this file with any text editor (notepad will do the job).  Locate the

following 2 lines of code:

<font size=+0><pre>

$admuser = "adminuser";

$admpass = "adminpass";

</pre></font>

Change the "adminuser" username and "adminpass" password to whatever you like, but please -- just change them!  Be

certain that both are enclosed in quotes.<p>

You will also want to modify the line <pre><font size=+0>$datamethod = "mysql"</font>; </pre>so that it says <pre>
<font size=+0>$datamethod="odbc";</pre></font>
This will instruct Basmati to use ODBC data-sources instead of a MySQL database server.
<p>


<li>Basmati can be installed into a single directory if you desire.  For improved security, however, it is a good

idea to either secure administrator and faculty related files either using NTFS or by creating separate web-shares.  For more

details, contact your Basmati distributor.  Create a new directory and place all of the Basmati files <b>except</b> basmatidb.mdb

into this directory.  Assign appropriate permissions to this directory so that an anonymous web-user has read-only priveleges to

these files.





</center><p>

<li>

Create a web-alias for this directory.  Be certain that PHP functionality

is added to each of these directories.  (If necessary, you can test PHP functionality by repeating the test in step 1.)

I strongly encourage the use of SSL on this alias to further secure your entire system.  If you know how to implement it (and can

obtain a security certificate), do so!

<p>

<li>Next, you'll want to create a folder on your server that <b>cannot</b> be accessed via the web <b>or</b> your network.

This folder will contain the database file which should be secured from public access.

Copy the file "basmatidb.mdb" into this folder.  This file (basmatidb.mdb) is simply a Microsoft Access (97) database

file and can be opened with MS Access.  If you don't own a copy of MS Access (or don't want it on your server), don't despair,

you won't need it!

<p>

<li>

Create a folder called "tmp" on the <i>root</i> of the drive that contains the PHP script files.  For example, if your

files are on the D:\ drive, you need to create the folder "D:\tmp".  This folder is used to store temporary session

information from the users.  You may need to check this folder periodically

for build-up of temporary files and remove them.  PHP is supposed to flush these files out on its own, but I have seen

mixed results.

<p>

<li>Finally, you'll want to create an ODBC connection to this database file (basmatidb.mdb).  From control panel, locate the ODBC Data tool (if

you're using Windows 2000, you'll find it in the Administrative Tools as "Data Sources (ODBC)").  Once the ODBC Data Administrator tool is

open, click on the SYSTEM DSN tab.  Click the Add button.  Choose the "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)"  (be sure you use the

correct language).  A dialog box will appear.  The Data Source Name that you should use is "basmatidb" -- this can be changed later if you wish... just be

certain to edit the "basmaticonstants.php" file if you decide to use a different name.  Then, click the "Select" button in the Database section.

Locate the "basmatidb.mdb" file.  Click OK (twice).<p>

<li>That's it!  You've installed Basmati on your system.  Your next step is to create a school account and faculty login-accounts and use

your electronic gradebook to post grades to the site -- this signals a new set of instructions!
