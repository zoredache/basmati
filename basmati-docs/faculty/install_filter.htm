<h2>Installing the Basmati Filter</h2>
<hr>
<font size=+3>Y</font>ou will need to install a "filter" file so that Grade Machine
can properly export your grades to Basmati.  This is a simple process and only need
to be performed once for each computer that you use.  Follow the steps below:
<ol>
<li>Click <a href="bas_os.flt">here</a> to download the filter file (called bas_os.flt).
<li>Your web-browser should prompt you to save this file.  If given the choice, save this
file to the FILTERS folder within your Grade Machine folder.
<li>If you weren't given a choice where you should save the file, locate the file and then
copy it to the FILTERS folder within your Grade Machine folder.
</ol>
This filter will export all of your assignments for all grading periods within your Grade
Machine class.  Other filters are available that will allow you to specify which assignments
and grading periods should be exported.  Here is the complete list of filters:
<ul>
<li><b><a href="bas_os.flt">bas_os.flt</a></b> --  This is the original filter which will export
all assignments from all grading periods.  In Grade Machine's filter list, this is seen as Basmati (OS).
<li><b><a href="bas_osa.flt">bas_osa.flt</a></b> --  This filter will ask you which assignments
you would like to export.  In Grade Machine's filter list, this is seen as Basmati (OS-Assign Ask).
<li><b><a href="bas_impt.flt">bas_impt.flt</a></b> --  This is an IMPORT filter which can be used in conjunction with Basmati's "Get Passwords" page.  If you save the contents of the "importable" passwords page to a text file, you can use this filter to import passwords back into Grade Machine.  This filter will import into the MISC 2. column of the student window in Grade Machine.
<li><b><a href="bas_65os.flt">bas_65os.flt</a></b> -- This filter can be used if you are using Grade Machine version 6.5 or later.
