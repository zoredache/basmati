Netscape is unable to print password lists or grade reports due to themanner in which it caches information in the program.  We are working on a solution to this issue andNetscape has indicated that this will not be a problem in its next browser release.  To solve this problem,either use Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser or copy and paste the data from Netscape's windowinto another application (such as Microsoft Word) and print from this application.<li><b>Spaces in Course-Codes</b> 
<font color=brown>  Problem under investigation --
files will not post if space in course-code. 
</font>
 Please do not use any spaces in course-codes.  While your datawill post to the internet, it may not be possible to retrieve password lists.  We will be adding a routineto Basmati to replace spaces with a hyphen.  Until this feature is added, you will need to manuallyremove any spaces from your coursecodes.</ul>If you find other issues, please report them to <a href=mailto:support@basmatisoftware.com>support@basmatisoftware.com</a>.  Thanks!</body></html>
