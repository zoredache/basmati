<h2>EALR Index</h2>
<hr>
<font size=+3>Y</font>ou can "link" your assignments to Washington State standards by using
the Miscellaneous field within the Assignment table of Grade Machine.  For example, suppose
you just finished grading an assignment that relates to the Math 1.3 standard (understand and apply concepts and procedures from geometric sense 
) and Science 2.2 (apply science knowledge and skills to solve problems or meet challenges).  In
the Miscellanous column of Grade Machine, enter <b><tt> Math 1.3, Science 2.2</tt></b>.  This 
will trigger Basmati to "link" these assignments to the state standards -- providing parents and
students with more information about your assignment.
<p>
In the table below, you'll find the abbreviations to all of the standards.  To correctly enter these
into Grade Machine, simply type the abbreviation, a space, and then a number corresponding to the
specific strand.  If your assignment meets more than one standard, separate the list with commas.
<p>
You must also make certain that the phrase "<b>standard:wa</b>" is included in the MISC 3 field in the
Class Information menu.

<b>Coming soon -- </b> if you take the time to enter the standards within Grade Machine, we will soon
be able to provide you with various online reports that will allow you to analyze your classroom assessments
in terms of the standards.  For example, you'll be able to discover which strands you have covered and which
ones you haven't.  You'll also be able to obtain summary statistics for individual students.
