through the grade confirmation table to make sure that you don't see any zeros. 
<p>
Most often, errors will occur because of missing information in the <i>Class | Class Information</i> section of
Grade Machine.  Please re-visit <a href=prepare.htm>Preparing Grade Machine for Basmati</a> for more details.
