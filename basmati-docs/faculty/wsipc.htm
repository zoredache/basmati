<h2>WSIPC Considerations</h2>
<hr>
<font size=+3>O</font>ne of the features of Basmati is its tight integration
with WSIPC <a href="http://www.wsipc.wednet.edu">(Washington School Information Processing Cooperative)</a>.
By using Basmati, you can eliminate the need to bubble grade sheets (by pencil).  You can also eliminate the
need to use Web-Wise to submit grades.  Basmati has been designed to save you valuable time during grading periods -- simply
submit your grades to Basmati and you're done!
<p>
In order to take advantage of Basmati's WSIPC integration, it is very important that you enter
the course code and section number correctly.  <b>Even if you've imported student data from WSIPC,</b> you
must make certain that this data appears as suggested in the <a href=prepare.htm>Preparing Grade Machine for Basmati</a> document.
<p>
The most fool-proof method for ensuring the correct information is to look at your attendance sheets.  An example is provided below:

In the diagram above, you may find the coursecode for your class immediately following the "COR:".  In this case, the coursecode
is <b>MIC202</b>.  To find your section number, locate the one or two digit code following the slash (/).  In this case the coursecode
is <b>6</b>.  Hence, in Grade Machine's <b>Class | Class Information </b> menu item, you will enter this information as shown in the 
diagram below (only this information is being shown, you should certainly fill out the rest of this box as well).

<font size=+3>O</font>ther considerations when using WSIPC...
<br>
If you plan to export your grades to Basmati and use them to submit grades during grading periods, it is essential
that the student numbers are accurate within Grade Machine.  The spelling of a student's name does not need to be
correct, but the ID must be accurate.  ID's are entered in the ID column of the student window within Grade Machine
as illustrated below (student with ID 5555).  You may also submit comments to WSIPC through the Comments column in the Student Window of
Grade Machine.  To submit comments, simply separate the comment codes with commas.  An example is shown below:
<CENTER><img src = "student.gif"><br><b>OR...</b></br><img src = "mac11.gif"></center>
<p>
Finally, be aware that WSIPC will not accept A+'s or D-'s as acceptable grades.  If you allow Grade Machine to use
such grades, Basmati will automatically convert them to A's and D's when they are sent to WSIPC.
