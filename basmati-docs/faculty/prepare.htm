<h2>Preparing Grade Machine for Basmati</h2>
<hr>
<font size=+3>T</font>he first step to use Basmati is to provide Grade Machine with the
necessary information about your classes.  <b>Some of the information you will provide is
<i>critical</i> to the proper operation of Basmati.</b>  When you see the following symbol, please
pay particular attention: <font color="red" size = +2>§</font>
<p>
Before proceeding, make certain that you have your Basmati username and password (these should have
been provided to you by your Basmati administrator).

<p>You will now enter some information into the <b>Class | Class Information</b> section within
Grade-Machine.  From the menu, choose the <b>Class</b> main menu and then select the <b>Class Information</b>
sub menu.  A dialog box will appear that will look like this (assuming you haven't yet added anything to the
boxes):<br clear=all>
<center><img src = "blankinfo.gif">  <img src ="macblankinfo.gif"></center>
<p>
In the table below, you will find a discussion about what each field is used for within Basmati.  Again, pay careful
attention to those items marked with the special symbol.

<table border = 1>
<tr><td width = 25%><b>Field</b></td><td><b>Comments</b></td></tr>

<tr><td><font color="red" size = +2>§</font> Course Code <br>[REQUIRED]</td>
<td>This field should contain a course-code that identifies the class and is one of
the most critical fields to enter.  You must be certain that the information in this 
field is accurate, as it is used to construct portions of the database.  
If you are using WSIPC, click
<a href = "wsipc.htm"> here </a> for more details and examples.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Course Name<br>[REQUIRED]</td>
<td>The <i>Course Name</i> field should contain the title of your class.  You may enter whatever you wish
in this field.  This information will appear throughout the internet progress reports.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Grade Level</td>
<td>The <i>Grade Level</i> field may contain the grades of students enrolled in your courses.  This
information is not used anywhere within the database and may be left blank if you wish.</td></tr>
<tr><td><font color="red" size = +2>§</font> Section Number <br>[REQUIRED for WSIPC]</td>
<td> This is a critical field and must be entered accurately.  This is typically a 2-digit code (such as 03)
that is used to identify the different sections of similar classes.  If a single digit is used, a zero will
automatically be added to the left of the digit to force 2-digit values.
If you are using WSIPC, click
<a href = "wsipc.htm"> here </a> for more details and examples.</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<font color="red" size = +2>§</font>
<font color="red" size = +2>§</font>
Teacher ID
<font color="red" size = +2>§</font>
<font color="red" size = +2>§</font></td>
<td>This field contains your <b>password</b> as provided by your Basmati administrator.
You must type this <i>exactly</i> as it appears.  If this field is inaccurate, your
grades will not post to the internet!</td></tr>

<tr><td><font color="red" size = +2>§</font> Teacher Name <br>[REQUIRED]</td>
<td>The <i>Teacher Name</i> field should contain your name as you would like it to appear on 
internet progress reports.

<tr><td>Terms</td>
<td>This field should contain the terms during which your class is taught.  For example, if your class is
taught during first term, you should enter a 1 in this field.  If your class is taught during terms 1 <i>and</i>
2, you should enter 12 for this field.  This is not a required field.</td></tr>

<tr><td>
<font color="red" size = +2>§</font>
<font color="red" size = +2>§</font>
Misc 1.
<font color="red" size = +2>§</font>
<font color="red" size = +2>§</font></td>
<td>This field contains your <b>username</b> as provided by your Basmati administrator.
You must type this <i>exactly</i> as it appears.  If this field is inaccurate, your
grades will not post to the internet!</td></tr>

<tr><td>Misc. 2</td>
<td>This field is used to display a telephone number.  It is suggested that you only use your work telephone number for this
field.  This field may be left empty</td></tr>

<tr><td>Misc. 3</td>
<td>This field is used to control the display behavior within Basmati.  You may place any of the following expressions in this field:
<ul>
<li><b>-background</b><br>  This will remove the background image when the gradebook is displayed.  This may be useful
if the background image obscures some of the details.
<li><b>-mail</b><br>This will remove the hyperlink to your email address.  Use this if you do not want your email
address published.
<li><b>-misc</b><br>This will remove the Miscellaneous column from the gradebook page.  Use this if you don't use this
column within Grade Machine.
<li><b>-percent</b><br>This will remove the "percent-score" from being displayed in Basmati reports.  Typically this is
used in elementary reports or standards-based reports.
<li><b>standard:wa</b><br>When you use this attribute, the Miscellaneous field within the Assignment table becomes active
for reporting Washington State standards.  For additional information, <a href=ealrindex.htm>click here</a>.  
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Failing to supply the course-code will cause Basmati to reject your export file and no grades
will be posted to the internet.  It is very critical that the course code and section number
are entered accurately the first time.  If corrections to these fields are required, you will
need to contact your Basmati administrator to remove the incorrect versions from the database.
